How to Use the Template
Scene Description: In the "scene" field, provide a vivid description of the setting. Be as detailed as possible to help the AI generate the desired environment.

Character and Action: The "character" and "action_sequence" fields let you define who is in the video and what they're doing. This is where you can specify character consistency.

Technical Elements: The "camera", "lighting", and "style" fields allow you to control the cinematography of the video. Specifying these elements gives you granular control over the final output.

Audio Integration: Use the "audio" object to detail dialogue, sound effects, and music. Veo 3 can generate native audio, so being specific here is crucial for a complete video.

Image and Video References: The "visuals" object is where you can include URLs for images or videos that you want the AI to use as a starting point or a visual guide. This is key for incorporating your own media. Veo 3 API documentation shows that it can generate a video from an image, which you can specify with an image URL in your prompt.

Negative Prompts: The "negative_prompt" field is where you list elements you want the AI to avoid. This is a powerful way to refine your video and prevent unwanted artifacts or themes.
